This project is a Password Manager application built using Python's tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It helps users generate secure random passwords and save them, along with associated website and email information, into a text file for easy access. The password manager also allows users to copy generated passwords directly to the clipboard using the pyperclip library.

Features:
- Password Generation: Securely generate random passwords containing letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Data Entry: Add website, email, and generated password details into a local text file.
- Clipboard Functionality: Automatically copy the generated password to the clipboard for easy pasting.
- Form Validation: Alerts the user if required fields are left empty before saving data.
- Confirmation Dialog: Prompt the user to confirm the data before saving.
- Pre-filled Email Field: The email field is pre-filled with a default email for convenience, but it can be edited.
